---

 The goal of the proposed studies is to advance knowledge about the unique neuroadaptation of the human brain to the injury caused by chronic alcoholism. This project applies advanced neuroimaging to interrogate the disruption of neuroconnectivity in alcoholics and their potential compensatory neuroadaptation. Quantitative measurement of brain white matter microstructure will be assessed by fiber tracking with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI); scalp-recorded EEG and event- related potentials (ERPs) will reflect the synchrony of brain electrical potentials across large cerebral networks and their connectivity; intrinsic and task-related functional connectivity will be identified with functional MRI (fMRI and fcMRI) using both blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) and noninvasive cerebral blood flow (CBF) acquired with Pulse Continuous Arterial Spin Labeling (PCASL).
