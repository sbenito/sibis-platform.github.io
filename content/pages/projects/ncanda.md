<h1 align="middle">National Consortium on Alcohol and Neuro-Development in Adolescence</h1>

<br />

 The purpose of the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) is to determine the effects of problematic alcohol use on the developing adolescent brain and examine brain characteristics that predict alcohol use disorder. At five sites, the consortium will collect a core battery, including structural and functional brain scans and cognitive testing, and conduct specialty projects on psychological regulation, sleep and alcohol discontinuation. The examination of alcohol consequences will focus on structural and functional maturation of brain areas that actively develop during adolescence, are key to psychological regulation and reward response, and may be vulnerable to toxic alcohol effects.
